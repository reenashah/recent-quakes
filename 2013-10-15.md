####Setting a Roadmap
#####Part 1

1. Matching variable names in old source with variables in new source
2. Get Pandas 
3. create code to extract:
  1. cached data
  2. live data
4. Rearrange Columns to match order of original source

#### Roadblock:
+ Can't access live JSON data source: see https://github.com/stat157/recent-quakes/issues/2 (solved)
+ We can't figure out how to match up column names (might be resolved when we access live data)
+ Reena's Virtual Machine can't access the internet (solved)

#### Update: 2013-10-17
+ install latest version of pandas to access JSON parser: `sudo pip install --upgrade pandas`
+ change all "null" values to "NaN" so that python can interpret it
+ New Error: TypeError: expected string
